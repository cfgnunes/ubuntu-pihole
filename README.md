# Personal Ubuntu Server with Pi-hole: install and config

Script to install and configure my personal [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) inside a Raspberry Pi hardware.

This script:

- Configure the time zone;
- Update distro packages and remove unnecessary ones;
- Install the Pi-hole;
- Add some DNS servers;
- Add important AdBlock lists;
- Install a script to automatically disable distracting websites during workdays;
- Fix some errors in the Ubuntu Server distro for Raspberry Pi.

This project is for personal use, but it can help you to personalize your Ubuntu Server for Ad blocking.

## Getting Started

Just run:

```sh
    pihole-install.sh
```
